we used python 3.9, but the project should work with older versions
as well.

packages used: 

    - itertools 8.6.0
    - pytest-timeit 0.3.0 
    - joblib 1.0.0

to run the project run the main.py file, and an interactive menu should show up.

in order to add more datasets just insert them into the resource folder, 
and the menu should dynamically add that file.
